## 🌍 Vision

Humanity has mapped the genome. We’ve mapped the Earth.  
But we’ve never mapped *ourselves* — our shared story as a single species.  

**Project Origin** is a free, open educational VR platform that unites science, history, and empathy.  
It visualizes human ancestry, migration, and adaptation from the dawn of Homo sapiens to the modern day — personalized through DNA data and archaeological evidence.

Its mission is simple:  
> To show every human being that there is no “us vs. them.”  
> Only *us* — one adaptable species under many skies.

## 🕰️ Why Now

- **Open genetic data:** Public projects like 1000 Genomes, Max Planck, and Pääbo’s ancient DNA archives provide global, free datasets.  
- **Affordable VR hardware:** Meta Quest, HTC Vive, and Apple Vision Pro make immersive learning mainstream.  
- **AI & machine learning:** Modern AI can reconstruct ancient environments, languages, and human migration patterns.  
- **Cultural division:** The world is more polarized than ever. We need tools that re-teach shared humanity.  

The infrastructure to connect us already exists — it simply needs to be assembled.

## 🧩 System Overview

### **1. Data Layer**
- Open-source genetic datasets (23andMe summaries, 1000 Genomes, ancient DNA references)  
- Archaeological & linguistic databases  
- Climate and environmental data from NASA / NOAA  

### **2. Processing Layer (Python + Open AI)**
- Converts ancestry data into real-time migration routes  
- Maps adaptation traits (climate, diet, culture)  
- Generates personal lineage paths (opt-in DNA input only)  

### **3. Visualization Layer (Unity / Unreal Engine)**
- 3D Earth with evolving geography and population movements  
- Narrated VR experiences — *“Your ancestors left Africa 60,000 years ago…”*  
- Specialized modes:
  - 🪖 **Veterans:** resilience and lineage therapy  
  - 🧠 **Elders:** memory reconstruction for Alzheimer’s therapy  
  - 🎓 **Students:** unbiased history education  

### **4. Ethics & Privacy**
- Fully open-source, no ads, no data harvesting  
- Personal DNA stays local or encrypted  
- Non-commercial use only — free for life

## 🌐 Open Licensing & Sustainability

- Licensed under **Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0** — free to use for education and research.  
- Commercial licensing (for museums, institutions, or hardware bundles) may sustain hosting — never restricts public access.  
- All code, datasets, and documentation remain **open and forkable**.

## 🧠 Conceptual Roadmap

1. **MVP** – Use 23andMe ancestry summaries + Python script to generate basic migration maps.  
2. **VR Prototype** – Import GeoJSON into Unity/Unreal to visualize global movement.  
3. **Partnership Phase** – Collaborate with museums, educators, and geneticists.  
4. **Therapeutic Expansion** – Build adaptive modules for veteran and elder care.  
5. **Public Launch** – Open educational distribution via SteamVR and schools.

## 🕊️ Call to Action

We have the data.  
We have the technology.  
We need only the unity of purpose.

**If you believe education, empathy, and technology can bridge humanity’s divisions — join us.**

## ⚡ Quickstart (Prototype)


# **Step 1 — Generate lineage GeoJSON**
```bash
python scripts/origin_map.py --ancestry examples/ancestry_example.json --lookup examples/region_lookup.csv --out examples/your_lineage.geojson
```
# **Step 2 — Start a local server**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
# **Step 3 — View in browser**
Open http://localhost:8000/examples/viewer.html
*(Leaflet will load your_lineage.geojson and plot ancestry points)*

💡 Tip: To test your lineage map visually, edit `viewer.html` and change the `fetch('your_lineage.geojson')`
line to your generated file path if different.
